# Apparently some AVs are allergic to mingw and might make a false positive on the win(dows) builds, just ignore it i guess

# spongebob-case
bad Program that converts text to spongebob case (it's bad because it's very basic and i havent really done much c++ before so yeah i just made this in my free time to learn a bit)

i might add more stuff later when i become more familiar

i dont own the name spongebob (obviously)

compiling: literally `g++ Main.cpp` on linux (i built windows ones on linux with x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ lol don't ask me how to build on windows)
